# Project Brainstorming

*“Build with BASE. Ok. But what should I build?*

It might be that the sheer number of possible projects is making it hard to sit down and imagine one in particular to build.

*Note: This document does not seek to limit or discourage other ideas or projects that might be entirely different from those described below, nor do the examples given represent ideas or projects that will be favored by judges in any way if created by a participant in the event.*

Here’s just a few ideas that might get your train of thought out of the station an on its way:

## Build a matching service

A matcher service is one which can match user search requests to existing business offers.

## Personal Data importers

Import personal data from Google, Facebook, Fitbit, else

## Personal Data Analyzers / Classifiers

Analyze the raw data and generate “semantics” for the data that can be used for personalized offers
Eg:

* Areas of interest based on your search data
* crypto investor, blockchain developer, shopping for a car
* Fitness profile based on Fitbit data
* Runner, swimmer

**Got ideas that are even** ***better*** **than above?** [**Create a new issue**](https://github.com/bitclave/bitclaveHackathon/issues/new) **and build ‘em!**
